# Documentation Overview

This folder contains the figures and tables generated for the
Enviro–Human Dispersal Drivers project. Files fall into two categories:

1. **Processed figures** – final versions combined, edited, or arranged  
   using Inkscape for presentation and publication.

2. **Raw exported outputs** – graphics exported directly from R  
   during analysis (files ending in `_all`).

## Final Figures (Inkscape-edited)

### Figure_1_Dispersal_distance_distribution.PNG
Distribution of dispersal distances across taxa.

### Figure_2_Variance_trait_graphs_all.PNG
Variance partitioning showing contributions of trait and environmental drivers across taxa.

### Figure_3_Trait_driver_results_all.PNG
Results summarising trait–environment driver relationships.

### Figure_S1_Variance_random_effect_graphs_all.PNG
Supplementary figure showing variance explained by random effects.

### Table1_Dispersal_driver_predictions.PNG
Summary table of predicted effects of environmental and trait drivers.

These figures were assembled and formatted in Inkscape after combining  
outputs from multiple scripts.

## Raw Exports (`*_all`)

The following files are exported directly from R and represent  
taxon-combined or model-combined graphics before Inkscape editing:

- HUMANPRESSURES_all.PNG  
- PRODUCTIVITY_all.PNG  
- SEASONALITY_all.PNG  
- TEMPERATURE_all.PNG  
- TRAIT_DRIVERS_all.PNG  

These correspond to outputs from scripts 5–12 in the `/code` directory  
and serve as intermediate visualisations prior to generating the final figures above.

## Notes

- Final figures are publication-ready versions created from a combination of multiple R outputs.
- Raw `_all` figures are retained for transparency and reproducibility.
